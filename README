This project is meant to support accelerometer processing for SOL-VIDA sedentary behavior analysis. Raw ActiGraph,
ActivPAL, and Actical data is read in and merged on participant and datetime. Choi nonwear is calculated for Actigraph and
MVPA is calculated on the AG and AP data.

Actigraph_Sedentary and PAL_Sedentary scripts compute sedentary pattern variables based on Paul Hibbing's PBpatterns
R package.

CHAP 10s posture data is merged with the ActiGraph data and sed pattern variables are run on that as well. all sed
pattern variables are merged together into a day-level file along with the MVPA and weartime information.

TODO:
-script merging of preprocessed epoch data with CHAP output
-script for CHAP sed patterns
-script to merge all sed output into one daily sed file with other daily variables

**check that participant IDs are present in all files (including preprocessed epoch level files)

**check that files will merge correctly based on participant ids present in filename

Proposed data pipeline:
directories of device files:
pal (epoch level)
pal (extended events)
actigraph
actical
CHAP output (from Python script run separately)

**all files need to be named consistently with unique HCHS ID in the filename
one script merges pal epoch/actigraph/actical files -> creates epoch-level dataset
one script calculates sed pattern vars on the epoch dataset output from step 1 -> creates day-level sed pattern dataset
one script calculates sed pattern vars on the pal events file -> creates day-level sed pattern dataset
one script merges actigraph 60s epoch file with CHAP 10s output -> creates day-level sed pattern dataset
finally merge all sed pattern vars into one file and combine with the day-level aggregated version of the epoch file
    that was output from the first script. -> creates day-level MVPA and summary dataset INCLUDING all sed pattern vars
